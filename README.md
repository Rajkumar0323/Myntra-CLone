Myntra Clone with Real Backend
Overview
This project is a clone of Myntra, a popular online fashion store, built with a real backend without using external APIs. The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionality and user experience of Myntra, including user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart management, and order processing.

Features
User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and log out securely. Implement password hashing and JWT-based authentication for enhanced security.
Product Listing and Searching: Display a wide range of fashion products with filtering and search capabilities to help users find their desired items easily.
Product Details: Provide detailed information about each product, including images, descriptions, pricing, and customer reviews.
Shopping Cart Management: Allow users to add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed.
Checkout Process: Enable users to proceed to checkout, enter shipping details, select payment methods, and place orders securely.
Order History: Display users' order history with order details and status updates for tracking purposes.
Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building the RESTful API, MongoDB as the database to store user data, product information, and order details.
Frontend: React.js for building the user interface, Redux for state management, React Router for client-side routing, and Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
Styling: CSS for basic styling and responsiveness, with potential integration of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
Testing: Jest and Enzyme for unit testing React components, Supertest for testing Express.js endpoints.
Deployment: Heroku for hosting the backend API, Netlify for hosting the frontend application.
